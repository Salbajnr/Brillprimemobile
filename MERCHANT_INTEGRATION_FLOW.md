## Summary

The merchant dashboard system creates a **three-way ecosystem** where:

1. **Consumers** discover and purchase through an intuitive map-based interface
2. **Merchants** manage their business through comprehensive dashboard tools
3. **Drivers** fulfill deliveries through an efficient job management system

**No conflicts arise because:**
- Each role has distinct interfaces optimized for their needs
- Data flows seamlessly between roles without overlap
- Revenue streams are clearly defined and distributed fairly
- Communication channels are structured but interconnected
- The system scales naturally as each user type grows

This creates a **unified marketplace** where all three user types benefit from each other's presence, generating network effects that drive platform growth and profitability.
