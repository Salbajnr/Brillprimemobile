# Native Platform Development Structure

## Overview
This document outlines the structure and guidelines for continuing Brillprime development on native platforms (Android/iOS) in a different environment.

## Current Web Implementation
The current implementation is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with:
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Express.js backend with WebSocket support
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Comprehensive real-time features
- Role-based authentication and authorization

## Recommended Native Architecture

### Cross-Platform Framework Options
1. **React Native** (Recommended)
   - Reuse existing React components and logic
   - Shared codebase between iOS and Android
   - Native performance with JavaScript bridge
   - Large ecosystem and community support

2. **Flutter**
   - Single codebase for both platforms
   - Excellent performance
   - Rich UI components
   - Growing ecosystem

3. **Native Development**
   - iOS: Swift/SwiftUI
   - Android: Kotlin/Jetpack Compose
   - Best performance but requires separate codebases

### Recommended Tech Stack for Native (React Native)

#### Frontend (React Native)

```

#### Core Dependencies
- **Navigation**: @react-navigation/native
- **State Management**: @reduxjs/toolkit or zustand
- **HTTP Client**: axios or fetch
- **WebSocket**: react-native-websocket
- **Maps**: react-native-maps
- **Location**: @react-native-community/geolocation
- **Push Notifications**: @react-native-firebase/messaging
- **Camera**: react-native-camera
- **QR Scanner**: react-native-qrcode-scanner
- **Payments**: react-native-paystack-webview
- **Biometrics**: react-native-biometrics
- **Storage**: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

### Backend Integration
The existing Express.js backend can serve both web and mobile clients:
- API endpoints remain the same
- WebSocket connections work with React Native
- Authentication tokens can be stored in AsyncStorage
- Push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging

### Database & Real-time Features
- Maintain existing PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM setup
- WebSocket real-time features work with mobile clients
- Location tracking enhanced with native GPS
- Push notifications for background updates

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup & Core Features
1. Initialize React Native project
2. Set up navigation structure
3. Create basic authentication flow
4. Implement core screens (splash, onboarding, dashboard)

### Phase 2: Role-Based Features
1. Consumer features (shopping, orders, payments)
2. Merchant features (inventory, sales, analytics)
3. Driver features (deliveries, location tracking)
4. Admin features (oversight, management)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Real-time chat and notifications
2. Location tracking and maps
3. Camera and QR code scanning
4. Payment processing
5. Biometric authentication

### Phase 4: Platform-Specific Features
1. iOS-specific optimizations
2. Android-specific optimizations
3. App store preparation and deployment

## Code Reusability

### Highly Reusable (90-100%)
- Business logic and API calls
- State management patterns
- Data models and types
- Authentication logic
- WebSocket integration
- Utility functions

### Moderately Reusable (60-80%)
- Form validation logic
- Navigation patterns (adapted to native navigation)
- Component logic (UI will be native components)

### Platform-Specific (0-30%)
- UI components (native equivalents)
- Platform-specific APIs (camera, location, etc.)
- App store configurations
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Native-Specific Enhancements

### iOS Features
- Face ID/Touch ID integration
- Apple Pay integration
- iOS-specific push notifications
- App Store optimization

### Android Features
- Fingerprint authentication
- Google Pay integration
- Android-specific push notifications
- Play Store optimization

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+

### Environment Variables
```bash
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://your-backend-url.com

# Payment Configuration
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_xxx
GOOGLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID=xxx
APPLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID=xxx

# Maps & Location
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=xxx

# Push Notifications

FCM_SERVER_KEY=xxx
```

## File Structure Migration Map

### Current Web Structure → Native Structure
```
client/src/components/ → src/components/
client/src/pages/ → src/screens/
client/src/hooks/ → src/hooks/
client/src/services/ → src/services/
shared/schema.ts → src/types/schema.ts
```

### Key Components to Migrate
1. **Authentication Components**
   - Login/Signup screens
   - OTP verification
   - Role selection

2. **Dashboard Components**
   - Consumer dashboard
   - Merchant dashboard
   - Driver dashboard
   - Admin dashboard

3. **Real-time Components**
   - Notification center
   - Chat system
   - Order tracking
   - Location tracking

4. **Payment Components**
   - Wallet management
   - Payment methods
   - Checkout flow

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Jest
- Component tests with React Native Testing Library
- E2E tests with Detox
- Device testing on both iOS and Android
- Performance testing and optimization

## Deployment
- iOS: App Store Connect
- Android: Google Play Console
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions or similar
- Code signing and certificate management

## Next Steps for Native Development
1. Set up React Native development environment
2. Create new project: `npx react-native init BrillprimeNative`
3. Install required dependencies
4. Start with authentication and basic navigation
5. Gradually migrate features from web to native
6. Test thoroughly on both platforms
7. Optimize for platform-specific features
8. Prepare for app store submission

This structure provides a solid foundation for native development while maximizing code reuse from the existing web implementation.
