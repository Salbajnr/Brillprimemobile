The user wants a detailed, step-by-step structural explanation of how the app flow should work. I need to break down the navigation and user journey through all 8 screens, explaining the logic, decision points, and transitions between screens.

Let me think about this from a user experience perspective and map out the entire flow structure:

Entry point and onboarding
Main app functionality
Search and discovery
User account management
Merchant interaction
Shopping flow
I should explain:

User triggers/actions
Screen transitions
Decision points
Back navigation
State management
User goals at each step
Error handling
Alternative paths
